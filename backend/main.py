# mock api (usds seemed to use postgresql + fastapi, so we can simulate that?)
# might not build out anything here until the very end, since
# we're focusing on front-end design primarily. but i wanted the
# repo set up so that the architecture is all there.

# at the moment this is all front-end stuff, the "saving" mechanism to local-storage
# is done with the front-end but we would make api calls to save data and whatnot if this was for real
